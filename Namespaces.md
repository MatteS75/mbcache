# How namespaces are organized #

There are two namespaces in MbCache you normally use when you write your code. One used for configuration and one for runtime use.


## MbCache.Configuration ##

This namespace contains types you need to configure MbCache.

## MbCache.Core ##

This namespace contains types you need at runtime when creating proxies and invalidate cache entries.

## Other namespaces ##

Namespaces other than the ones above shouldn't normally be referenced from a normal user.
